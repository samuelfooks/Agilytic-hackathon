# Agilytic-hackathon

## What is it about?

Motorways, major railway lines etc. often form a barrier for cycling, either forcing long detours or
funnelling cyclists to unsafe roads to cross the barrier. But there is no clear idea how to measure
this effect, what can be considered a sufficient density of safe crossings or how to estimate the
necessary number of crossings when preparing a large infrastructure project.

### What we did?

Analysed the provided data and did some exploratory work. You can also follow the analysis in:

* [exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/sedat01/Agilytic-hackathon/blob/main/exploration.ipynb)
* [crossing_points.ipynb](https://github.com/sedat01/Agilytic-hackathon/blob/main/crossing_points.ipynb)

We also prepared an interactive map of the current existing crossings with color indication of how far is it from the closest neighbouring one. We also included the population density in the calculation, so a unit of distance in densely populated area gets darker color than the same unit in less populated area. You can follow the jupiter notebook or just browse the html file, which is also uploaded on a webserver for even easier access:
